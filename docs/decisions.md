# Decisions

Why PleaseNoBugs is the way it is. Newest at the bottom. When a decision is
reversed, add a new entry rather than editing the old one, so the reasoning
that was tried survives.

## 2026-10-14: Where it comes from

Extracted from the feedback board in [Shitti](https://shitti.me), a Nimiq Pay
mini app, where it had been running since August 2026. Shitti will consume the
published package instead of its own copy, so there is one version and every
improvement lands in both.

## 2026-10-14: Open source and hosted, both

MIT licensed and self-hostable, plus a hosted instance where a developer needs
only a project id. Many mini apps have no backend of their own, so the hosted
route is what makes this easy; self-hosting is what makes it trustworthy.

Cost: the hosted instance means being responsible for uptime, abuse and other
apps' data.

## 2026-10-14: Identity is a Nimiq wallet

One vote per wallet, owners are wallet addresses, no accounts and no email.
Built behind an interface so another kind of login could be added, but Nimiq is
the only one.

## 2026-10-14: Proofs are scoped to a project and an origin

Shitti signs one fixed sentence, which is safe with one app. On a shared server
it would let any app reuse its users' signatures on every other board. The
signed message names the project and the origin. Cost: a user of an app that
already signed them in signs once more, the first time they post or vote.

## 2026-10-14: Reading is public

Anybody may read a board without signing. The signature is asked for at the
first post or vote, when the user has a reason to give it. Cost: everything
posted can be read outside the app. Authors and voters stay hidden.

## 2026-10-14: Headless client plus a web component

A framework-free client and matcher for developers who want their own UI, and a
`<please-no-bugs>` web component on top for everybody else. Mini apps are
written in React, Vue, Svelte and plain HTML; a React component would serve one
of the four.

## 2026-10-14: Names come from the app, or from the user

The host app may suggest a display name (it often knows one); the user can
change it; without one the post is anonymous. Stored per wallet per project.

## 2026-10-14: No notifications in v1

Owners see an "unseen since your last visit" count in the dashboard. Webhooks
(Discord, Slack) are the obvious next step and can be added without breaking
anything.

## 2026-10-14: Self-service project creation

A small dashboard: sign in with a wallet, enter a name and an origin, get a
project id and the snippet to paste. That wallet becomes the owner.

## 2026-10-14: Name

PleaseNoBugs. Funny, unique, free on npm. It also covers ideas, which the
tagline says. Not called "Nimiq ..." because it is not an official Nimiq
product, and `@nimiq` is Nimiq's own npm scope.

## Open

- Domain (`pleasenobugs.com` / `.dev`), not yet checked.
- Ask the Nimiq team whether they want to point mini app developers at it.
- Where the hosted instance runs.
